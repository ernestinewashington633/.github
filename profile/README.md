I am a passionate software developer with over 8 years of experience in building robust applications. My expertise lies in back-end development with a strong focus on Node.js, Python, and Java, backed by a solid understanding of databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I have worked extensively with front-end technologies including React and Angular, creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

My journey in software development has allowed me to collaborate with diverse teams on various projects, ranging from e-commerce platforms to enterprise-level applications. I take pride in my ability to write clean, maintainable code and believe in the importance of agile methodologies for project management.

I am also an advocate for open-source software and actively contribute to multiple projects, sharing my knowledge and helping others in the community. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and working on personal projects to challenge myself and improve my skills.

Here are some of my pinned repositories that showcase my work:
